# Isomorphism

Implementation of papers on random graph isomorphism.
1. [Random Graph Isomorphism - Babai, Erdos, Selkow](http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/SAUCY/papers/1980-35.pdf)
2. [Improved Random Graph Isomorphism - Czajka, Pandurangan](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570866707000147)

Major changes to algorithm -
* Hash based sorting in place of sorting by arrays
* Use of backup key based on degree neighborhood in case of key failure, for Paper 1 (indexer)

Sample Usage - main.py

Individual files -
* generator.py - generates random graphs, isomorphic pairs, saves these, or loads adjacency matrices from regular text files
* indexer_algo.py - contains class indexer, implmenting paper 1 above
* sequencer_algo.py - contains class sequencer, implmenting paper 2 above
* verify.py - contains function check_match, which applies labels provided to check for isomorphism
* main.py - playground for trying implmentations, contains sample usage
* graph_... - sample isomorphic pairs generated by generator
